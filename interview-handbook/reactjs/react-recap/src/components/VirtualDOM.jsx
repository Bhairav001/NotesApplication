1. In React.js, the Virtual DOM(Document Object Model) is a programming concept where a virtual representation of the actual DOM elements is kept in memory.

2. The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.

3. React uses it to improve performance by minimizing the number of direct manupulation the the actual DOM


Here's How the Virtual DOM works in detail:

1. Initial Render
- When a React component is firstt rendered, React creates a virtual representation of the DOM called the Virtual DOM

2. Changes in State or Props
 - when the state or props of the React component change, React doesn't immediately update the real DOM
 - Insted, if first updates the Virtual DOM with the new state or props


3. Reconciliation:
